            <h2>Cannabis and depression</h2>
            <p>Cannabis oil is the fastest alternative to antidepressants. It stimulates the endocannabinoid system and
                accelerates the growth and development of nervous tissue with minimal side effects. Treatment of
                depression with cannabis oil is a natural and natural remedy that provides patients peace of mind.
                Cannabis oil also helps combat stress, relieves anxiety, relieves insomnia, improves appetite, provides
                energy and concentration, and improves mood.
                A 2006 study found that episodic or daily use of cannabis reduces the level of depressive symptoms.
                Another study showed that THC in cannabis oil can change a person’s reaction to negative emotions or
                images by stimulating the endocannabinoid system in the brain.
                Since stress is one of the primary causes of depression, moderate cannabis use stabilizes mood and
                relieves stress.
