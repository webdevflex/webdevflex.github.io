                        <p>Constant warnings of doctors about the danger of smoking, promotion of healthy lifestyles, a
                              ban on smoking in public places and an increase in the price of tobacco products – are the
                              major anti-smoking measures, taken by governments of the majority industrially developed
                              countries.</p>
                        <p>These measures to combat smoking bring some results, but the mass cessation of smoking cannot
                              be still achieved and the number of active smokers is still growing.</p>
                        <p>Aggressive advertising policy of tobacco products has led to the fact that younger generation
                              has erroneous stereotypes and false conceptions about the true danger of smoking.
                              Cigarette manufacturers create bright, beautiful and dynamic promotional video in which
                              young, successful, purposeful and energetic people with pleasure inhale a cigarette.</p>
                        <p>The main purpose of such advertising to convince young girls that a cigarette will give an
                              image of grace and elegance and to convince young men that a cigarette in their hands will
                              give them courage and confidence.</p>
                        <p>Sale of cigarettes is primarily a business, so manufacturers of tobacco products set
                              themselves a unique problem – any way to attract potential buyers’ attention.</p>
                        <p>Producing “Light Cigarettes” and “Women’s Cigarettes” with low tar and nicotine,
                              manufacturers of tobacco products advertise them as a “safer cigarettes”, but it’s not
                              quite true.</p>
                        <p>“Light cigarettes” actually contain less of chemical elements and carcinogenic substances,
                              dangerous for the body. But smoking of “light cigarettes” does not get rid of nicotine
                              addiction, that is why people just increase the number of “safe ” cigarettes a day.</p>
                        <p>Smoking of only one cigarette a day for 1 month, increases the risk for nicotine addiction in
                              the hundreds. But many people do not understand or do not want to understand, believing
                              that they will be able to abandon this harmful habit at any moment. </p>
                        <p>All the complexity of the struggling against smoking is that nicotine, containing in tobacco
                              smoke causes not only psychological but physiological addiction too.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that nicotine is a poison, it is released by the body in small amounts. In
                              biological oxidation, nicotine is converted to nicotinic acid which is an essential human
                              nutrients (vitamin PP).</p>
                        <p>Also nicotine has an effect on the person’s brain, stimulating the release of
                              neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and dopamine. Neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and
                              dopamine increase the activity of thought processes and mental energy, relieve tension and
                              anxiety, improve concentration and increase vital tonus. That is why, a man feels a burst
                              of energy and vitality after smoked cigarette.</p>
                        <h2>Tobacco quit</h2>
                        <p>Tobacco smoking leads to the fact that overabundance of nicotine in the body, “runs” a
                              complex physiological system of self-regulation, controlling the concentration of nicotine
                              in the various organs, soft tissues and blood of a man. The function of self-regulation is
                              in that the organism ceases independently to release nicotine, getting it in abundance
                              together with tobacco smoke.</p>
                        <p>In heavy smokers, the release of nicotine by the body completely stops, so during the first
                              attempt to give up smoking, the body starts to experience the nicotine hunger. As a rule,
                              a severe shortage of nicotine in the body manifests by the state of discomfort and stress,
                              impaired concentration, change in taste sensations and digestive disorders.</p>
                        <p>Nicotine hunger is a temporary phenomenon, since the body gradually resumes the release of
                              nicotine, but it occurs not earlier than 3-4 weeks after giving up smoking. The first
                              month of smoking cessation becomes the most difficult for a man, suffering from nicotine
                              addiction. If a man during this period can cope with nicotine hunger, it is possible to
                              assert that the man has coped with the nicotine addiction forever.</p>
                        <p>In 1 month after smoking cessation, the body starts gradually to restore the balance of
                              nicotine in the body, but just after 3 month, the nicotine will completely release in the
                              body.</p>
                        <p>Thus, smoking cessation is primarily disruption of the physiological and psychological
                              addiction to nicotine. That is why a struggle against smoking for the most people becomes
                              a test of their moral stability and willpower.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that it is possible to get rid of the nicotine addiction just for several
                              months, not every man can show his strength of character and independently to stop
                              smoking. This assertion due to the fact that under the influence of industrial,
                              scientific, technological and information revolution, an absolute majority of urban
                              residents daily are exposed to stresses and negative influence of technogenic environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>By refusing smoking, a man should be ready to the fact that the first month he will expose
                              his body to additional psychological load and if a state of stress overcomes his
                              willpower, he will not be able to give up smoking.</p>
                        <p>In the cases when a person attempts to give up smoking, but independently he cannot to
                              achieve the goal, he can use various methods of the struggling against smoking, some of
                              them help quickly and effectively to get rid of the nicotine addiction.</p>
                        <p>The most popular and publicly available ways to give up smoking are:</p>
                        <ul class="list_content">
                              <li>nicotine replacement therapy</li>
                              <li>psychotherapy of nicotine addiction</li>
                              <li>pharmacological treatment of nicotine addiction</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Duration and cost of nicotine addiction treatment depend on what method of treatment a person
                              will choose.</p>
