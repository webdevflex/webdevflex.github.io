            <h1>Accutane Information</h1>
            <p>Accutane is a Vitamin A formulation used for treating severe forms of nodular acne. The drug lowers the
                activity of oil glands in the skin, making it healthier and able to renew itself faster. Accutane is
                usually prescribed in cases where other anti acne drugs have manifested themselves to be ineffective.
            </p>

            <h2>Taking Accutane</h2>
            <p>Take Accutane exactly as prescribed by your doctor. You may be scheduled additional checks and blood
                tests while taking the drug, so make sure to not miss any single of them. Take Accutane with enough food
                or milk, don't chew or crush the tablet as the content may cause irritation.</p>


            <p>Accutane is known to cause severe side-effects in new born babies so make absolutely sure you're not
                pregnant or are going to become pregnant during or after a short time after the medication course. FDA
                strongly imposes birth control mechanisms to be employed during the course of Accutane.</p>

            <p>Never share Accutane with anyone else even if the person has the same problems and diagnosis as you have.
            </p>


            <p>Store it in a dry and dark place at room temperature.</p>


            <h2>Accutane warnings and precautions</h2>

            <p>Avoid taking vitamins and dietary supplements containing Vitamin A during your course of Accutane. Being
                a form of Vitamin A itself, you may experience overabundance of the substance, which may be harmful to
                your health.</p>

            <p>Do not donate blood while taking Accutane and for at least 3 months after the course. The donated blood
                may be given to pregnant women, which in turn would result in severe side effects in the fetus
                development.</p>


            <p>Avoid tanning and excessive exposure to the light, waxing or laser hair removal procedures as the
                sensitivity of the skin will be increased and this may result in bruising.</p>

            <h2>Accutane side-effects</h2>

            <p>In case you have symptoms of allergy to Accutane you should seek medical assistance as soon as possible:
                swelling, hives, difficulty breathing. Some of the more serious side effects that require you to stop
                taking the medications and contact your doctor immediately include:</p>
            <ul class="list">

                on with your schedule just as always. Take the drug around the same time every day.</p>
