            <h1>Top Reasons Why Accutane Should Be Purchased Online</h1>

            <p> <strong> Accutane</strong> or isotretinoin is a known drug that treats severe acne breakouts. Although
                sold in brick and mortar pharmacies, buying Accutane online is also possible but why should you buy the
                drug from an online source? Here are five reasons why:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>1. The acne medication is pretty expensive and buying it online means lots of savings for the buyer.
                    There are comparison websites that have a database of reputable online pharmacies and having access
                    to such a database will give you an idea where to buy your isotretinoin at real competitive rates.
                </li>
                <li>2. You get to choose from a number of deals. Since you can compare online pharmacies right on the
                    get go, it would be easier for you to look for reputable online pharmacies that sell isotretinoin
                    and other drugs at rates you can afford. Many people who suffer from severe acne conditions do not
                    buy the drug because it is pricey but if there are deals available from online pharmacies, it is
                    something that these people can take advantage of.</li>
                <li>3. Buying isotretinoin online is more convenient as compared to you having to go to your local
                    pharmacy. This also makes it possible for you to just wait for your isotretinoin order to be
                    delivered to your door.</li>
                <li>4. Buying online will also give you a better insight on whether the drug is the right acne
                    medication for you. With so much information available on the web, you will get a better picture of
                    what the drug does â€“maybe even more information than what your dermatologist told you.</li>
                <li>5. Aside from getting access to the most popular isotretinoin brand, you will also be given other
                    brand suggestions that are cheaper than your previous brand of choice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Warning</h2>
            <p>Online buyers should be careful in choosing which online pharmacy they will be buying isotretinoin from.
                Choosing reputable online pharmacies like ours is very important since there are now so many illegal
                operators of online pharmacies that might be selling imitation drugs.</p>
            <p>Getting a prescription from your doctor is vital. Isotretinoin is quite effective but it is not for
                everyone. People with a history of heart disease, ailments rooting from mental illness, liver disease,
                and ulcers are not supposed to take the isotretinoin or any of its brands. This includes Accutane among
                others. Accutane is quite effective in treating acne but a consultation with a dermatologist is still
                vital.</p>
