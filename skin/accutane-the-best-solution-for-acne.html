            <h1>Accutane – The Best Solution for Acne</h1>
            <img src="img/acne-recovery.webp"
                alt="Accutane, Acne, Uses of Accutane, Accutane users, Common dosage, medication instructional, dose of Accutane">
            <p> <strong> Accutane</strong> That Accutane is the best solution for acne is a fact that numerous takers of
                the drug can attest to. It is definitely a very potent drug and highly effective in eradicating
                breakouts and some other blemishes. </p>

            <p>This medication is taken by mouth. It is first and foremost recommended and prescribed to cure grave
                cases of acne. They say it is a form of Vitamin A that acts to decrease the amount of oil emitted by the
                oil glands on the skin. </p>

            <p>The drug facilitates skin renewal and this occurs on the skin more rapidly.</p>

            <h1>Uses of Accutane</h1>

            <p>The solution is also used for a number of other purposes not indicated in the medication instructional
                sheet that comes along with the drug. This medication is used to manage acute cases of nodular acne.
            </p>

            <p>The drug is typically administered following attempts to try out some other acne medications and
                antibiotics. When these drugs were tried and were found to be ineffective in treating the discomforting
                symptoms, the last resort has always been Accutane.</p>

            <h2>Common dosage recommended to Accutane users</h2>


            <p>This drug is sold in the form of a pill. Hence, it is given by mouth and the common dosage is in the
                quantity of 0.5 milligrams to 1.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. The dosage of the pills
                given to clients is recommended to be taken with meals.</p>

            <p>A usual cycle of medication is taken between fifteen and twenty weeks. Physicians do not advise that the
                drug be administered once a day on a regular basis.</p>

            <p>The reason for this is that usage of too much doses of this medication into the systems of the body can
                result to unfavorable outcomes. Majority of the patients divide their dosage in half and take the
                medications twice daily.</p>

            <h2>Missed Accutane dose</h2>

            <p>When a patient has missed a dose of Accutane, he or she has to omit the missed dose and take the
                medication during the following regularly arranged schedule. It is definitely not advised to administer
                additional medication to make up for the missed dose.</p>

            <h2>Overdose of the drug</h2>

            <p>If ever, too much of Accutane had been given to a patient, it is imperative for him or her to be assessed
                by a medical practitioner to be administered prompt medical intervention. </p>

            <p>Signs and symptoms of an overdose of Accutane may include an unsettled stomach that leads to vomiting,
                stomach cramps, nausea, dizzy spells, and headache. With other patients, the lips begin to swell while
                some may report a tingling sensation under the skin. Also, the patient’s coordination and balance may be
                affected.</p>

            <p>Anyhow, the fact remains that Accutane currently assists a lot of people who have been enduring their
                health problem and discomfort for so long.</p>


            <p>Presenting evidence lately to a government committee for health, a renowned physician documented that
                thirty percent of patients with acne problems continued until adulthood. If these people had been given
                the drug Accutane by their healthcare providers, the problem may have been resolved early on.</p>
