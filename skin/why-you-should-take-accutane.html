            <h1>Why You Should Take Accutane</h1>

                alt="cystic acne, acne, side effects, isotretinoin, benefit of using isotretinoin">
            <p><strong>Accutane (Isotretinoin)</strong> is known acne medication that is deemed as an extremely potent
                drug that treats nodular or cystic acne. Although the drug has several side effects from dryness of the
                skin to headaches, taking Accutane has a number of benefits too. This includes reducing oil glands on
                the skin and decreasing oil production as a whole.</p>

            <p>Sebaceous glands are responsible for providing the skin with natural oil keeping the skin moisturized,
                soft, and supple. Too much of it however can result to the development of pimples and in some cases of
                acne. How come this happens? This is a common question because oil, after all, is supposed to be a good
                thing especially if it makes the skin look better.</p>

            <p>However, one has to keep in mind that there is bacteria called the P. acnes that is produced together
                with natural oil on the skin and the more oil there is, the more bacteria will be activated. </p>

            <p>To control the production of facial oil, isotretinoin is given by dermatologists. This basically helps in
                reducing oil production, reducing the number of pimples of the user along the way.</p>

            <p>The drug is also effective in reducing inflammation specifically inflamed acne nodules that is why it is
                quite popular among dermatologists and individuals who suffer from severe acne conditions. Aside from
                getting rid of inflammation, this benefit of taking isotretinoin also results to less scarring on the
                skin.</p>

            <p>Since nodular acne often leave ugly marks due to collagen disruption and occupying far too much space by
                inflaming the pores, the reduction of inflammation on pimples helps in keeping the pores intact and
                collagen undisrupted which leads to little to no scars.</p>

            <p>
                Another benefit of using isotretinoin is that it slows down skin cell production. Too much of it can
                clog the pores which later lead to acne breakouts. According to dermatologists, the buildup of skin
                cells also entails the buildup of bacteria. The latter later on results to inflamed pores i.e. pimples.

            </p>
            <p>The slowing down of skin cell production on the skin is important for the treatment of severe acne
                because this helps clear the skin. Doctors say that there is a need to slow it down so that isotretinoin
                or Accutane can catch up with the healing of inflamed pores. </p>
            <p>There are a lot of benefits one can get from Accutane but there is still a need to consult your doctor
                before taking it.</p>
