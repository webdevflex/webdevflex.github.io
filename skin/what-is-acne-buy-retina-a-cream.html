            <p>Fundamentally speaking, acne are protruding pores or stubs that come in the form of blackheads,
                whiteheads, pimples or bigger cysts that blemish several teenaged faces, necks, chests, backs, shoulders
                and upper arms. Speaking more about acne, it is a social pain, a beauty disgrace the becomes the cause
                for stress in many teenaged minds.</p>
            <p>Acne is not a disease in itself, nor does it have any fatal ends. The medical name for pimples is Acne
                vulgaris. True to its name, the agony in the incidence of acne is the perceiving of it as vulgar. It is
                caused by changes in the pilosebaceous units of the skin which include the sebaceous glands. It commonly
                occurs in the inflammatory form, but non-inflammatory acne is also found, though less commonly. </p>
            <p>Acne occurs during adolescence and is actually seen as signs of puberty or approaching puberty. It
                affects almost 85% of teenagers, irrespective of their race, colour, and region. Apart for leaving
                behind scars, which are sometimes permanent in extreme cases, acne causes psychological shadows like a
                low self-esteem and depression. This is because, 100% of teenagers want to look good, and acne is not a
                pretty sight to look at.</p>
            <p>On this website you can find reviews of different acne creams that may help you decide which acne cream
                is the most suitable for your type of skin. When you find the acne cream that suits you most it is
                advisable to consult your doctor before using it. Now go ahead and find the acne cream that will help
                you to reduce the acne. </p>
            <h2>Common Acne Treatments</h2>
            <p>However, one thing must be noted and rejoiced over. Virtually, almost every type of acne can be cured
                today. This is because there are several treatments available for curing acne. Only in USA we spend
                millions of dollars on gels and acne creams annually and this has only fueled more research work into
                finding faster cures for acne. Most teenagers, by mental gravity, just kill the pimple by squeezing it
                or flattening it out. Though this might give a temporary solution, it might leave scars behind and is
                often painful.</p>
            <p>Benzoyl Peroxide is proven to be an efficient anti-acne cream and is a major constituent of most of the
                acne creams and gels that are available. But care must be taken while administrating Benzoyl peroxide as
                it has an acidifying effect on hair and fabric and might bleach it to obscurity.</p>
            <p>Apart from these, acne can also be treated based on severity, by various ways like using topical
                antibiotics, oral antibiotics, hormonal treatments and laser therapies. But laser therapies have to be
                done by professionals as they might have severe side affects if not administered properly. Aloe-Vera is
                also an effective Ayurvedic cure for acne, which has much lesser side effects.</p>
