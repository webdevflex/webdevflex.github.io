                    <p>Accutane is a Vitamin A formulation used for treating severe forms of nodular acne. The drug
                        lowers the activity of oil glands in the skin, making it healthier and able to renew itself
                        faster. Accutane is usually prescribed in cases where other anti acne drugs have manifested
                        themselves to be ineffective.</p>
                    <p>Taking Accutane
                        Take Accutane exactly as prescribed by your doctor. You may be scheduled additional checks and
                        blood tests while taking the drug, so make sure to not miss any single of them. Take Accutane
                        with enough food or milk, don't chew or crush the tablet as the content may cause irritation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Accutane is known to cause severe side-effects in new born babies so make absolutely sure you're
                        not pregnant or are going to become pregnant during or after a short time after the medication
                        course. FDA strongly imposes birth control mechanisms to be employed during the course of
                        Accutane.

                    <p>No matter what are you are acne can strike at the worst times. Acne is a skin problem caused by
                        imbalanced hormones and chemistry in your body.</p>
                    <p> Retin A is the treatment for your skin to keep your outbreaks to a very minimum. Retin A also
                        will
                        allow your skin to heal without the scars because it promotes quick healing.</p>
                    <p>Using Retin A is easy to use. Retin A is a cream that you put on your skin using a very thin
                        layer.
                        Retin A is applied before you are ready to go to bed for the night so it can work while you
                        sleep.</p>

                    Last summer I was on accutane for about 2 months and my acne was gone. It was one of the best
                    decisions.</p>

                <p>I was on Accutane from about August of 2018 until April of 2019. That stuff worked serious wonders on
                    my skin and I never experienced side effects.</p>

                <p>I had acne on my cheeks. It is amazing how Retin-A works on the skin. I am much happier about my skin
                    now, and I must say that it is nice to see other people become happier to get rid of their acne. So
                    good results wow!</p>

                <p>I took accutane for six months at 120 mg a day (which is the max dosage they will give you), and it
                    was one of the best decisions I have ever made. My experience with Accutane was very positive.</p>

                <p>I took accutane, not for my face but mostly for shoulders and back. Worked great for me. Accutane is
                    amazing I went on it twice and it was the only thing that got rid of my acne.</p>
