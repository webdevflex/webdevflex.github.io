There are several causes that lead to creation of dark circles under the eyes some of the important ones are as follows: unhealthy eating habits, rubbing the eyes, insufficient sleep, rise in body temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, and improper eye protection.

One of the most cited causes for dark circles is that of broken blood vessels. It is said that rubbing your eyes often can break blood vessels under the eyes and create dark circles.

                <p>You need to have good sleep in order to get sparkling eyes. Sleeplessness is also one of the many causes for dark circles. Try to get good sleep for a minimum of seven to nine hours a day also avoid drinking excess fluids before you sleep because fluids can accumulate around your eyes in case your head remained in a lower position than your body. If you feel the rise in your body temperature is the reason behind the dark circles under your eyes, cooling your eyes could be the best solution for it. For example you can cool you eyes and surrounding areas by placing slices of cucumber or potato for about ten minutes. You can also splash cold water or use ice wrapped in a cloth to cool your eyes. Using milk to cleanse you eye can have a soothing effect. Using rosewater generously has been an age old eye therapy for dark circles. </p>

                <p>Too much of exposure in the sun can be the cause of dark circles as well. In this case you need to stay away from the shine. Or you can utilize your sunglasses to protect your eyes from the harmful rays of the sun. Although all of the above mentioned remedies work well when it comes to removing the dark circles under eyes, it is a time taking process and you need to be patient until you find the results. However, there are makeup kits that can conceal any dark circles around the eyes. You can use these makeup kits to hide the dark circles until you are relived of them. </p>
