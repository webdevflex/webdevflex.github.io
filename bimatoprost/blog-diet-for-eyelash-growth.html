                <h1>Diet for eyelash growth?</h1>
                <img src="./img/blog_18.webp" alt="Diet for eyelash growth?">
                <p>The first thing that needs to be included in the diet for long eyelashes is keratin-rich foods. Since
                    keratin in its structure is a protein, then you need to look for it among the relevant food. A lot
                    of keratin contains lean meat. You need to eat chicken, lamb and lean beef. A certain proportion of
                    keratin is found in cheese and milk.</p>
                <p>But, so that the eyelashes are thicker and longer, proteins alone are not enough. It is very
                    important to use fats, and, only unsaturated. A large number of such substances contains olive and
                    flaxseed oil. Many unsaturated fats in fish and other seafood. If there are nuts, then the need for
                    fats can be met.</p>
                <p>Nutrition for the growth of eyelashes should contain the necessary micronutrients. To eyelashes were
                    long, you need to eat foods with iron and zinc. There is a lot of iron in liver, apricots, yolk,
                    meat, lentils and brewer's yeast. If you play sports, then foods with iron in your diet should be
                    enough, since physical activity consumes a lot of this microelement. You also need to eat pumpkin
                    and sunflower seeds, cocoa and oysters, in which a lot of zinc.</p>
                <p>The lack of silicon is not the main reason for the poor state of the hairs, but if it is observed,
                    their growth can slow down. Silicon has a lot of fruits and vegetables in its peel, so you need to
                    eat them with it. The necessary trace element is contained in cucumbers and strawberries.</p>
                <p>Sulfur can also help grow long and thick eyelashes. You need to eat potatoes, onions, cabbage,
                    zucchini and raspberries.</p>
                <p>To lashes were long, in addition to the necessary trace elements in your diet should be a lot of
                    vitamins, especially useful for the growth of eyelashes.</p>
                <p>Vitamin A is very important for the growth of eyelashes. They are rich in carrots, grapes, fish oil,
                    milk, broccoli, cheese and liver. Long eyelashes will help make vitamin E, nicknamed beauty vitamin.
                    If you want to make the eyelashes longer, you should eat grains, nuts, vegetable oils.</p>
                <p>B vitamins are simply indispensable for good growth of all hair and improve skin condition. To be in
                    the body, you need to eat buckwheat, liver, fish, yeast, bananas, prunes and bread. It is useful to
                    take vitamins in pure form, however, you should not forget that it is possible to make eyelashes
                    longer with the help of vitamin multicomplexes.</p>
                <p>Do not forget to use a sufficient amount of water that prevents hair loss.</p>
                <p>If you carry out all the above procedures regularly, with a special emphasis on nutrition, then soon
                    you will achieve the desired effect by increasing the thickness and length of hairs. Do not forget
                    to rinse eye makeup daily. Special care deserve eyelashes, which were subjected to curling and
                    coloring.</p>
