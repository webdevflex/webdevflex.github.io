                        oils and oil mixtures, prepared by yourself, or special cosmetic products. Let's talk first
                        about some popular methods of strengthening and enhancing the growth of eyelashes, which you can
                        use:</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Castor oil.</strong> Anyone who has ever looked for information on the Internet about how to
                    strengthen eyelashes, met recommendations to put on the eyelashes of castor oil. This method is
                    really quite effective, but it has its drawbacks. Oil can provoke swelling of the eyelids, get on
                    the mucous membrane, leaving the film on the eyes, as well as cause irritation.</p>
                <p>It should be applied to the eyelashes (by the way, it is also used if you need to grow eyebrows) with
                    a brush. You can take a brush from the old mascara, wash it very well with soap or shampoo, and then
                    use it to distribute the oil on the eyelashes. Every time you use the brush, you also need to wash
                    it, do not forget about it.</p>
                <p><strong>Almond oil. </strong>Due to its composition, this oil perfectly nourishes hair follicles and
                    gives cilia substances that are necessary for their growth and strength. This oil contains vitamin E
                    (which is the main vitamin responsible for the beauty of eyelashes), as well as a large amount of
                    essential amino acids, minerals, etc. </p>
                <p><strong>Vitamins A and E</strong>purchased in capsules at the pharmacy separately or Aevit, which is
                    a combination of these two vitamins, is also actively used and shows excellent results when the task
                    is to grow long, strong, thick eyelashes. You can use vitamins separately, and you can add them to
                    the base oil: castor, olive, coconut, peach, etc.</p>
