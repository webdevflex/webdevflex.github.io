                <p>Eyelashes - long, thick - the dream of any girl. But like any human organ, they are subject to
                    various diseases. Some of them are the result of rash and careless actions. </p>
                <p>What are eyelash diseases? What are the symptoms of the pathological process? Is there an adequate
                    treatment or is there only one way out - plucking the affected hairs?</p>
                <p><strong>Eyelash diseases and their symptoms</strong> </p>
                <p>Eyelash diseases can be divided into 2 groups - parasitic lesions and changes in the physiological
                    features of the structure of the organ.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>The first group includes:</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>pediculosis</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>demodicosis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the first case, pubic lice cause the disease. Their head relatives on the eyelashes and other
                    areas covered with hair do not live. Infection occurs by contact.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Symptoms of the disease:</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>itching</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>conjunctivitis</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>gray bloom on the hairs</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>traces of blood.</li>
                </ul>


                <p> In the second case, the infectious agent is a microscopic mite. This insect lives in the ducts of
                    the hair follicles and sebaceous glands and is considered representative of the conditionally
                    pathogenic microflora.</p>

                <p>Most often, this disease is diagnosed in veterinary practice, but it is also found in humans.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Signs of pathology:</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>discharge from the eyes</li>

                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>hypertrophy of the eyelid margin</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>reduced production of tear fluid</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>development of dry eye syndrome</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>hair loss</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>The second group of diseases is associated with impaired growth of eyelashes and their number.
                        Pathologies of this group include:</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>trichiasis - in this case, the eyelashes grow in the wrong direction in the direction of the
                        eyeball. There may be a single hair, and maybe a lot - along the entire length of the edge of
                        the eyelid</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Distichiasis is a congenital pathology, in which 2 strips of hairs grow on each eyelid. That is,
                        doubling the number of hairs</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>hypertrichosis - an acquired disease. Increase the number of hairs with a normal number of
                        ciliated rows</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>hypotrichosis - you can find a photo on the Internet - the complete or partial absence of hairs.
                        Often this is an acquired pathology, which is a consequence of a severe illness with aggressive
                        treatment.</li>
                </ul>



                <p>All of these pathologies may be accompanied by conjunctivitis, blepharitis, in severe cases, a
                    corneal ulcer or sclera develops.</p>

                <h2>Diagnostics and treatments</h2>

                <p>For a preliminary diagnosis, visual inspection by an ophthalmologist is sufficient. If you suspect:
                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>pediculosis - microscopic examination is shown to identify the parasite</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>demodicosis - skin scraping to identify a microorganism</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>other pathologies - examination and counting the number of hairs in the ciliary row</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Therapeutic tactics depend on the diagnosis and is selected individually for each case. In addition
                    to the treatment of the underlying disease, antibiotic concomitant therapy and vitamin drops are
                    shown to improve the condition of the eye analyzer
                </p>

                <ul class="list">

                <h2>Pediculosis treatment</h2>

                <p>The principle of therapy is to destroy adults and nits. This will have to remove the habitat of the
                    parasites. The hair is cut off.</p>

                <p>Other parts of the body are treated with anti-pediculosis preparations, but it is desirable to remove
                    the hair covering in the armpits and in the pubic zone. Erythromycin ointment is applied to the
                    growth zone of the eyelashes 3 times a day.</p>

                <p>In addition - renovation of the premises and clothing, anti-pediculosis preparations for persons who
                    have come in contact with the patient.</p>

                <h2>Demodecosis</h2>

                <p>Treatment of this disease involves an integrated approach. Showing both system-wide and local drugs,
                    diet, means to improve the body's defenses.

                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Metronidazole or drugs based on it orally.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Trichiasis</h2>



                <p> The treatment of this pathology is to remove hairs that grow in the wrong plane with respect to the
                    ciliary row. The techniques consist in mechanical pulling, cryotherapy, electrolysis or surgical
                    removal of the affected area.
                    Additionally, the treatment of associated diseases.</p>

                <p> Changes in the color and number of hairs
                    A change in the color of the eyelashes and their complete loss does not cure, but is only observed.
                    They are treating diseases that supposedly caused this pathology.</p>
                <p>
                    The excess ciliary row, incorrectly overgrown hairs are removed with the help of surgical
                    intervention. If the disease does not cause inflammation in the eye system, then the patient is
                    under dynamic observation.</p>

                <p>From which the lashes fall out?
                    Hair loss in the edge of the eyelid is a normal situation if up to 5 hairs are lost per day. New
                    grow fast. If there is a loss of more eyelashes, this may indicate a number of pathological changes
                    in the body.</p>


                <p>Why lashes fall out:</p>
                <p>Wearing eyelash extensions for a long time.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Stress and unhealthy diet, lack of vitamins and minerals, the use of extreme diets.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Hormonal imbalance.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Acceptance of certain drugs on an ongoing basis.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Inflammatory processes in the tissues of the visual analyzer.
                        If you notice that the eyelashes began to fall out, any system-wide symptoms were added, then
                        you should go through a comprehensive examination.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Pulling eyelashes - how to treat the disease?
                    Trichotillomania is a pathological condition in which there is an obsessive craving for pulling out
                    hair on the head, eyebrows, and eyelashes.
                    Causes of obsessive state are disorders in higher mental activity. </p>

                </ul>
                <p>Without the elimination of the stress factor that causes the desire to pull out your hair, any
                    methods of treating trichotillomania are not effective.</p>

                <p><strong> General recommendations for the preservation of the health of eyelashes</strong>
                    In order for cilia to grow long and healthy, it is not necessary to visit beauty salons and spend
                    mad funds.</p>

                <ul class="list">

                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Daily care can be budget:</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Do not torture natural cilia with endless extensions. Adhesives for attaching hairs - it's still
                        aggressive chemistry</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Do not constantly use curling tongs. It will make them dull</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Use only high-quality cosmetics. And in the evening, be sure to do makeup removal</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Periodically feed the hair with any natural oil - olive, castor, almond. Even good quality
                        sunflower will do</li>

                </ul>
                <p>This is enough to prolong the life of the eyelashes, make them thicker, and the eyes are bright and
                    inviting.</p>
