                    <h3>Uses</h3>
                    <p>   Bimatoprost is a popular antiglaucoma treatment for external use in eye drops form. Most often it occurs in the medicinal drops Latisse or in the Lumigan eye drops so if you have to buy bimatoprost you have to get it to purchase Latisse online. 
                        It can be applied to cure age-related eye diseases such as ocular (eye) hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Actually, it is an eye med but it can also be used to treat the eyelash hypotrichosis or the lack of eyelashes – and to stimulate the eyelashes growth and strength. That kind of treatment is held by the special cosmetology approved meds – Careprost you can buy online without a prescription recipe.  
                     </p>
                    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
                    <p>Bimatoprost works to replenish the amount of liquid which drains from the eye to reduce the inside pressure. It is prescribed by the optometrists for glaucoma treatment and to decrease the influence of some special conditions leading to the eye high pressure.</p>
                
                
                    <img class="f2" src="img/original.webp" alt="Bimatoprost Online Usa">    
                    <h3>Prescriptions for Use</h3>
                    <p>   Bimatoprost is the medicine that needs to accomplish strictly instructions of the medics and directions on the prescription label. Do not increase the dosage or use the increased amount of the liquid or don’t change the prescribed period of use with no medical consultation previously. Take the bottle of the eye drops with clean hands only before using the medication and do not use it if the liquid has any signs of deterioration, it is not clear or has some kind of sediment. 
                        How to use Bimatoprost:
                     Tilt your head back and pull with your fingers lower eyelid to create a kind of pocket.
                     Tip the dropper down, look up and away from its tip.
                     Use the prescribed number of drops then close your eye.
                     Press your finger to the inside corner of your eye to prevent the liquid from draining or use a sterile cotton wool pad for it.
                     Wait for 5 minutes.
                     There is a restriction for the Bimatoprost containing meds – they are not appropriate to use in combination with contact lenses wearing, as it may lead to their discolouration. Remove the lenses before treatment and do not put them back for 15 minutes. Medical consultation is required in case you have been infected, as well as if you have an eye injury or if your eye surgery is already planned.
                     </p>
                    
                    <h3>Side effects</h3>
                    <p>In case you have pronounced allergy reactions stop the therapy using the Bimatoprost containing meds and call emergency. If you have any of the following symptoms as vision changes, red and swollen eyes, itching sensation or pain in the eye area then take a visit to your doctor for therapy correction. 
                        There is a list of more often side effects of Bimatoprost that includes dizziness; slight eye discomfort; dry eyes; watery eyes; burning or stinging sensation in the eyes; feeling as if some particles are in the eye. The list is not full because of the variants of your personal health condition that can occur some other side effects while treating. 
                     </p>
                     <h3>There are also some precautions you should know before you buy Bimatoprost</h3>
                     <p>Allergy and high sensitivity to the Bimatoprost are the first and the main one precaution. You shouldn’t buy Latisse, Careprost or their analogues in case of allergic sensitivity to bimatoprost’s components.
                        Using Bimatoprost ophthalmic may lead not only to the lashes’ changes it can also cause the saturation of your eyes colour (the brown pigment becomes more visible). The changes occur gradually and may be unnoticeable for years. If you are using it only for one eye, it may lead to the eventual difference between the colours of your eyes. It hasn’t been identified whether Bimatoprost affects the health of an unborn baby. 
                        Also, it is not recommended to the patients having a “dry eye” syndrome or to those who wear contact lenses.
                        Pregnant and breastfeeding women (or those planning to) are advised to notify their medical specialist priorly.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Interactions With Other Drugs</h3>
                     <p>Bimatoprost is unlikely to interact with any other medications. However, patients are recommended to notify their medical specialists prior to using Bimatoprost.</p>
