                <h1>Vitamins for eye health</h1>

                <img src="img/puffi2.webp" alt="Best vitamins for eye health">

                <p>Antioxidants and vitamins are very essential in order to have healthy and sparkling eyes. While eye health supplements available in the market often contains all of the vitamins for eye health, your everyday diet can provide you with the required vitamins for eyes. Here, we list out a number of foods that supply all the vitamins eyes might require along with their benefits.

                </p>
                

                <p>According to Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) people that need special attention for eyes should include the following in their diet for better results. Beta carotene is a nutrient that fights against night blindness and dryness in eyes. Foods that are rich in beta carotene include carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, kale and the like. Bioflavonoids are especially great when it comes to protection against cataracts and macular degeneration. Some of the rich sources of bioflavonoids include red wine, tea, oranges, blueberries, legumes, etc. </p>

                <h2>Vitamins for eye health floaters</h2>


                <p>Lutein and Zeaxanthin too are extremely helpful in preventing cataracts and macular degeneration. Spinach, kale and greens are some of the foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin. Omega-3 Fatty Acids apart from its other benevolent purposes also helps in preventing dryness in eyes and macular degeneration. Some of the well known sources of Omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, mackerel, herring, walnuts, flaxseed oil, and fish oils.</p>

                <p>The mineral selenium actually works like a catalyst and hastens the process of healing this is why it is always recommended with carotenoids or vitamin C and Vitamin E to boost their effects on the eyes. Foods rich in selenium include sea foods such as shrimp, and crab, other sources include brown rice Brazil nuts. However intake of selenium during pregnancy should be done only after consulting the physician. </p>

                

                <p>The benefits of Vitamin A are well known to everyone. Almost every ophthalmologist prescribes this in the event of an eye problem. This not only strengthens the ocular nerves but also works in a preventive measure against dry eyes and night blindness. Some of the foods rich in Vitamin A include milk, egg, butter, chicken and sea foods. Vitamin C is yet another benevolent ingredient in the eye care arena. If you need to protect your eyes against cataracts and macular degeneration then it is important that you regularly consume oranges, strawberries, broccoli and cantaloupe.

                </p>

                <p>Vitamin D is also important in checking macular degeneration and the food sources rich in Vitamin D include salmon, sardines, mackerel, milk, oranges, etc. Best of all our bodies can generate Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. This is why ophthalmologists recommend sun bath for healthy eyes. </p>


                <p>Foods rich in Vitamin E, such as almonds, sunflower oil and hazelnuts can help you in reducing the risk of advanced (age related macular degeneration) AMD. Zinc present in foods like oysters, beef, crab, and turkey has the ability to prevent night blindness and also advance AMD. </p>

                <p>Although obtaining the above minerals and vitamins via natural diet is the best way, at times it becomes unavoidable to take them in the forms of pills and syrups due to scarcity of these foods in certain parts of the globe. While natural sources can be a regular part of your diet, it is always recommended that you consult your physician before consuming them in the form of pills or syrups, which are available in pharmacies.</p>
